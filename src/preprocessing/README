preprocess.c 
    Takes one image (pnj,jpg)  ,returns processed bmp image 
        Process are :
            Import 
            Denoise
            Grayscale
            Binarization
            Contrast
    
    ex : 
        make (makes the preprocess executable)
        ./preprocess chosen_image.pnj output_image_name.bmp


man_rota.c 
    Takes one image (pnj,jpg) and a given angle  ,returns rotated bmp image 
        Process are :
           Rotation
    
    ex : 
        make man_rota (makes the man_rota executable)
        ./man_rota chosen_image.pnj angle output_image_name.bmp


auto_rota.c 
    Takes one image (pnj,jpg),returns rotated bmp image 
        Process are :
            Preprocessing (Import , Denoise , ...)
            Estimation of angle 
            Rotation

    
    ex : 
        make auto_rota (makes the auto_rota executable)
        ./auto_rota chosen_image.pnj output_image_name.bmp
